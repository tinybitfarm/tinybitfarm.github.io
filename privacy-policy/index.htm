                <p>In this policy, we lay out: what data we collect and why; how your data is handled; and your rights with respect to your data. We never sell your data.</p><br>
<p>This policy applies to all products built and maintained by Tiny Bit Farm LLC including <a href='https://lightpost.app'>Lightpost</a> and any product created and maintained by Tiny Bit Farm LLC.</p><br>
<p>This policy applies to our handling of information about site visitors, prospective customers, and customers and authorized users (in relation to their procurement of the services and management of their relationship with Tiny Bit Farm). We refer collectively to these categories of individuals as “you” throughout this policy.</p><br>
<p>However, this policy does not cover information about a customer’s end users that Tiny Bit Farm receives from a customer, or otherwise processes on a customer’s behalf, in connection with the services provided by Tiny Bit Farm to the customer pursuant to an applicable services agreement (including the content of messages of customer end users (“End User Communications”)). Tiny Bit Farm processes End User Communications under the instructions of the relevant customer, which is the “data controller” or “business” (or occupies a similar role as defined in applicable privacy laws), as described in the applicable services agreement between such customer and Tiny Bit Farm. Tiny Bit Farm’s obligations as a “data processor” or “service provider” with respect to such information are defined in such services agreement and applicable data protection addendum and are not made part of this policy.</p><br>
<p>If you are a customer’s end user and you have questions about how your information is collected and processed through the services, please contact the organization who has provided your information to us for more information.</p><br>
<h2 id='What we collect and why'>What we collect and why</h2><br>
<p>Our guiding principle is to collect only what we need. Here’s what that means in practice:</p><br>
<h3 id='Identity and access'>Identity and access</h3><br>
<p>When you sign up for a Tiny Bit Farm product, we ask for identifying information such as your name, email address, and maybe an organization name. That’s so you can personalize your new account, and we can send you product updates and other essential information. We may also send you optional surveys from time to time to help us understand how you use our products and to make improvements. With your consent, we will send you our newsletter and other updates. We sometimes also give you the option to add a profile picture that displays in our products.</p><br>
<p>We will never sell your personal information to third parties, and we won’t use your name or organization in marketing statements without your permission either.</p><br>
<h3 id='Billing information'>Billing information</h3><br>
<p>If you sign up for a paid Tiny Bit Farm product, you will be asked to provide your payment information and billing address. Credit card information is submitted directly to our payment processor and doesn’t hit Tiny Bit Farm servers. We store a record of the payment transaction, including the last 4 digits of the credit card number, for purposes of account history, invoicing, and billing support. We store your billing address so we can charge you for service, calculate any sales tax due, send you invoices, and detect fraudulent credit card transactions.</p><br>
<h3 id='Product interactions'>Product interactions</h3><br>
<p>We store on our servers the content that you upload or receive or maintain in your Tiny Bit Farm product accounts. This is so you can use our products as intended. We keep this content as long as your account is active. If you delete your account, we’ll delete the content within 90 days.</p><br>
<h3 id='General Geolocation data'>General Geolocation data</h3><br>
<p>For most of our products, we log the full IP address used to sign up a product account and retain that for use in mitigating future spammy signups. We also log all account access by full IP address for security and fraud prevention purposes, and we keep this login data for as long as your product account is active.</p><br>
<h3 id='Website interactions'>Website interactions</h3><br>
<p>We collect information about your browsing activity for analytics and statistical purposes such as conversion rate testing and experimenting with new product designs. This includes, for example, your browser and operating system versions, your IP address, which web pages you visited and how long they took to load, and which website referred you to us. If you have an account and are signed in, these web analytics data are tied to your IP address and user account until your account is no longer active.</p><br>
<h3 id='Anti-bot assessments'>Anti-bot assessments</h3><br>
<p>We may use CAPTCHA across our applications to mitigate brute force logins and as a means of spam protection. We have a legitimate interest in protecting our apps and the broader Internet community from credential stuffing attacks and spam. When you log into your Tiny Bit Farm accounts and when you fill in certain forms, the CAPTCHA service evaluates various information (e.g., IP address, how long the visitor has been on the app, mouse movements) to try to detect if the activity is from an automated program instead of a human. The CAPTCHA service then provides Tiny Bit Farm with the spam score results; we do not have access to the evaluated information.</p><br>
<h3 id='Advertising and Cookies'>Advertising and Cookies</h3><br>
<p>Tiny Bit Farm occasionally runs ads on various third-party platforms. Users who click on one of our ads may be sent to the Tiny Bit Farm marketing site. Where permissible under law, we may load an ad-company script on their browsers that sets a third-party cookie and sends information to the ad network to enable evaluation of the effectiveness of our ads, e.g., which ad they clicked and which keyword triggered the ad, and whether they performed certain actions such as clicking a button or submitting a form.</p><br>
<p>We also use persistent first-party cookies and some third-party cookies to store certain preferences, make it easier for you to use our applications, and to support some analytics.</p><br>
<p>A cookie is a piece of text stored by your browser. It may help remember login information and site preferences. It might also collect information such as your browser type, operating system, web pages visited, duration of visit, content viewed, and other click-stream data. You can adjust cookie retention settings and accept or block individual cookies in your browser settings, although our apps won’t work and other aspects of our service may not function properly if you turn cookies off.</p><br>
<h3 id='Voluntary correspondence'>Voluntary correspondence</h3><br>
<p>When you email Tiny Bit Farm with a question or to ask for help, we keep that correspondence, including your email address, so that we have a history of past correspondence to reference if you reach out in the future.</p><br>
<p>We also store information you may volunteer, for example, written responses to surveys. If you agree to a customer interview, we may ask for your permission to record the conversation for future reference or use. We will only do so with your express consent.</p><br>
<h3 id='How we approach mobile app permissions'>How we approach mobile app permissions</h3><br>
<p>We offer optional desktop and mobile apps for some of our products. Because of how the platforms are designed, our apps typically must request your consent before accessing contacts, calendar, camera, and other privacy-sensitive features of your device. Consent is always optional and our apps will function without it, though some features may be unavailable. There are a few exceptions, for example:</p><br>
<ul>
<li>Our iOS apps may ask for permission to use push notifications upon first sign-in.</li>
<li>Android apps do not require permission to send push notifications.</li>
</ul><br>
<h2 id='When we access or disclose your information'>When we access or disclose your information</h2><br>
<p>To provide products or services you’ve requested. We use some third-party subprocessors to help run our applications and provide the Services to you. We also use third-party processors for other business functions such as managing newsletter subscriptions and sending customer surveys.</p><br>
<p>We may disclose your information at your direction if you integrate a third-party service into your use of our products.</p><br>
<p>No Tiny Bit Farm human looks at your content except for limited purposes with your express permission, for example, if an error occurs that stops an automated process from working and requires manual intervention to fix. These are rare cases, and when they happen, we look for root cause solutions as much as possible to avoid them recurring. We may also access your data if required in order to respond to legal process (see “When required under applicable law” below).</p><br>
<p>To help you troubleshoot or squash a software bug, with your permission. If at any point we need to access your content to help you with a support case, we will ask for your consent before proceeding.</p><br>
<p>To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding restricted uses. Accessing a customer’s account when investigating potential abuse is a measure of last resort. We want to protect the privacy and safety of both our customers and the people reporting issues to us, and we do our best to balance those responsibilities throughout the process. If we discover you are using our products for a restricted purpose, we will take action as necessary, including notifying appropriate authorities where warranted.</p><br>
<p>Aggregated and de-identified data. We may aggregate and/or de-identify information collected through the services. We may use de-identified or aggregated data for any purpose, including marketing or analytics.</p><br>
<p>When required under applicable law. Tiny Bit Farm is a U.S. company with its main data infrastructure located in the U.S.</p><br>
<ul>
<li>Requests for user data. Our policy is to not respond to government requests for user data unless we are compelled by legal process or in limited circumstances in the event of an emergency request. However, if U.S. law enforcement authorities have the necessary warrant, criminal subpoena, or court order requiring us to disclose data, we must comply. Likewise, we will only respond to requests from government authorities outside the U.S. if compelled by the U.S. government through procedures outlined in a mutual legal assistance treaty or agreement. It is Tiny Bit Farm’ policy to notify affected users before we disclose data unless we are legally prohibited from doing so, and except in some emergency cases.</li>
<li>Preservation requests. Similarly, Tiny Bit Farm’ policy is to comply with requests to preserve data only if compelled by the U.S. Federal Stored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C. Section 2703(f), or by a properly served U.S. subpoena for civil matters. We do not disclose preserved data unless required by law or compelled by a court order that we choose not to appeal. Furthermore, unless we receive a proper warrant, court order, or subpoena before the required preservation period expires, we will destroy any preserved copies of customer data at the end of the preservation period.</li>
<li>If we are audited by a tax authority, we may be required to disclose billing-related information. If that happens, we will disclose only the minimum needed, such as billing addresses and tax exemption information.</li>
</ul><br>
<p>Finally, if Tiny Bit Farm is acquired by or merges with another company — we don’t plan on that, but if it happens — we’ll notify you well before any of your personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p><br>
<h2 id='How we secure your data'>How we secure your data</h2><br>
<p>All data is encrypted via SSL/TLS when transmitted from our servers to your browser. The database backups are also encrypted. In addition, we go to great lengths to secure your data at rest.</p><br>
<h3 id='What happens when you delete content in your product accounts'>What happens when you delete content in your product accounts</h3><br>
<p>In many of our applications, we give you the option to trash content. Anything you trash in your product accounts while they are active will be kept in an accessible trash can for about 30 days (it varies a little by product). After that time, the trashed content cannot be accessed via the application and we are not able to retrieve it for you. The trashed content may remain on our active servers for another 30-90 days, and copies of the content may be held in backups of our application databases for up to another 90 days after that. Altogether, any content trashed in your product accounts should be purged from all of our systems and logs within 90-180 days.</p><br>
<p>If you choose to cancel your account, your content will become immediately inaccessible and should be purged from our systems in full within 90 days. This applies both for cases when an account owner directly cancels and for auto-canceled accounts.</p><br>
<h3 id='Data retention'>Data retention</h3><br>
<p>We keep your information for the time necessary for the purposes for which it is processed. The length of time for which we retain information depends on the purposes for which we collected and use it and your choices, after which time we may delete and/or aggregate it. We may also retain and use this information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Through this policy, we have provided specific retention periods for certain types of information.</p><br>
<h3 id='Location of site and data'>Location of site and data</h3><br>
<p>Our products and other web properties are housed in the United States. If you are located outside of the United States, please be aware that any information you provide to us will be transferred to and stored in the United States. By using our websites or Services and/or providing us with your personal information, you consent to this transfer.</p><br>
<h2 id='Changes and questions'>Changes and questions</h2><br>
<p>We may update this policy as needed to comply with relevant regulations and reflect any new practices.</p><br>
<p>Have any questions, comments, or concerns about this privacy policy, your data, or your rights with respect to your information? Please get in touch by emailing us.</p>
