<p>If you’re ever unhappy with any Tiny Bit Farms Services or products for any reason, contact our support team.</p><br>
<h2 id='Lightpost' class="font-semibold text-xl">Lightpost</h2><br>
<p>With Lightpost, we sell subscriptions on a monthly basis only. If you pay for a month of Lightpost and then cancel before the month is up,
we make sure you are not charged in the future. Your account will be accessible until your paid period ends.
After that, your account will become inaccessible but your data will stay safe with us for 90 days.
That gives you time to export your data.
After 90 days, we’ll permanently delete all data from the account.</p><br>
<h3 id='Examples of full refunds we’d grant:'>Examples of full refunds we’d grant:</h3><br>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;" class="ml-6">
<li>If you were just charged for your next month of service but you meant to cancel, we’re happy to refund that extra charge.</li>
<li>If you forgot to cancel your account a couple months ago and you haven’t used it since then, we’ll give you a full refund for a few back months.</li>
<li>If you tried one of our products for the first month and you just weren’t happy with it, you can have your money back.</li>
</ul><br>
<h3 id='Examples of partial refunds or credits we’d grant:'>Examples of partial refunds or credits we’d grant:</h3><br>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;" class="ml-6">
<li>If you forgot to cancel your account a year ago, and there’s been activity on your account since then, we’ll review your account usage and figure out a partial refund based on how many months you used it.</li>
<li>If you upgraded your account a few months ago to a higher plan and kept using it in general but you didn’t end up using the extra features or storage space, we’d consider applying a prorated credit towards future months.</li>
<li>If we had extended downtime (multiple hours in a day, or multiple days in a month) or you emailed customer service and it took more than 4 business days to get back to you, we’d issue a partial credit to your account.</li>
